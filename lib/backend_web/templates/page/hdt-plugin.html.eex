<div class="subtitle is-4">Known Issues</div>
<li>
    Replay link in <a target="_blank" href="/my-replays">My Replays</a> is wrong (it opens a Firestone link for an invalid game)
</li>
<li>
    Streaming now functionality doesn't work (but streamer decks does - it updates after you finish games)

<li>
    No update mechanism, ie you have to manually download new versions for future updates

<div class="subtitle is-4">Troubleshooting</div>
<li>
You can check that it is installed by going to Options -> Plugins and also verify that it is enabled and which version it is
</li>
<li>
If it's not installing then perhaps HDT is installed in a non default location? Also check <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:8994/hdt-plugin">HDT instructions</a> for installing plugins
</li>
<li>
For feedback or additional help see the #hdt-extension channel in my <a target="_blank" href="/discord">Discord</a>
Include the hdt log file located here %appdata%\HearthstoneDeckTracker\Logs\hdt_logs.txt - this file is recreated if you restart hdt, there will be others in the folder so if it's in an old file
</li>
<li>
Older versions available <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17uaVxEkhKpilzA1LAOZQi2_NXllsa3Lm?usp=sharing">here</a>
